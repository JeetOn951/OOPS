Each object can have data (attributes) and actions (methods). OOP makes code more reusable, organized, and easier to manage.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 2. **What is a class in OOP ?**\n","\n","- Think of a **class** as a blueprint. Like a blueprint for building a car—it defines what a car should have (wheels, engine) and do (drive, brake). In code, a class defines how its objects will behave.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 3. **What is an object in OOP ?**\n","\n","- An **object** is the real version made from the blueprint. If `Car` is the class, then your Honda or BMW is an object. It has all the features defined in the class.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 4. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?**\n","\n","* **Abstraction** is **hiding the details** and showing only the essentials (like using a smartphone without knowing how its circuits work).\n","* **Encapsulation** is **keeping the data safe** by wrapping it inside a class and controlling access (like putting valuables in a locker).\n","\n","\n","\n","### 5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n","\n","- \"Dunder\" stands for **double underscore**. Methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__len__` are dunder methods. They add special behavior to objects and allow things like printing, comparisons, etc., to work naturally.\n","\n","\n","### 6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP**\n","\n","- **Inheritance** allows a class to get features from another class. For example, if `Bird` is a base class, `Parrot` can inherit from it and automatically get the ability to \"fly\" or \"chirp\".\n","\n","\n","\n","### 7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n","\n","- **Polymorphism** means “many forms.” It allows different objects to respond to the same function in their own way. For example, both `Dog` and `Cat` might have a `speak()` method, but one says \"Woof\" and the other \"Meow\".\n","\n","\n","\n","### 8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n","\n","- In Python:\n","\n","    **i.** We use **underscore `_` or double underscore `__`** to mark variables as private.\n","\n","    **ii.** We create **getters and setters** using methods or decorators like `@property` to safely access or update values.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 9. **What is a constructor in Python?**\n","\n","\n","- The `__init__()` method is called **automatically when an object is created**. It’s used to **initialize attributes** of the object (like setting the name or age).\n","\n","\n","\n","### 10. **What are class and static methods in Python?**\n","\n","- * **@classmethod** receives the class (`cls`) as the first argument. It can **modify class-level data**.\n","  * **@staticmethod** doesn’t take `self` or `cls`. It behaves like a normal function inside the class, just grouped there for convenience.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 11. **What is method overloading in Python?**\n","- Python doesn't support traditional overloading like C++ or Java. But we can fake it by using **default arguments or `*args`/`**kwargs`** to handle different scenarios.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 12. **What is method overriding in OOP?**\n","\n","- **Overriding** happens when a child class **redefines** a method of the parent class. It’s like a child saying, “I’ll do this my own way.”\n","\n","\n","\n","### 13. **What is a property decorator in Python?**\n","\n","- The `@property` decorator makes a method **behave like an attribute**. It’s used to access private variables in a clean way—without calling a function.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n","\n","- Polymorphism allows flexible and reusable code. You can write functions that work with **different object types**, as long as they follow the expected behavior (like all animals having a `speak()` method).\n","\n","\n","\n","### 15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n","\n","- An abstract class **can't be instantiated** (you can’t create an object of it). It’s like a template where **some methods must be implemented** by any subclass. You define it using `abc` module.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 16. **What are the advantages of OOP?**\n","\n","* Clean, modular structure\n","* Code reuse via inheritance\n","* Easier to maintain and debug\n","* Encapsulation for security\n","* Polymorphism for flexibility\n","\n","\n","\n","### 17. **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n","\n","- Multiple inheritance means a class can **inherit from more than one parent class**. Python supports this, though it can get tricky—Python resolves conflicts using the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 18. **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n","\n","* **Class variable**: Shared across all objects. (e.g., company name)\n","* **Instance variable**: Unique to each object. (e.g., employee name)\n","\n","\n","\n","### 19. **Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python**\n","\n","* `__str__`: Defines the **user-friendly** string (used by `print()`).\n","* `__repr__`: Defines a **developer-friendly** string (used in debugging or console).\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","```python\n","def __str__(self):\n","    return \"User-friendly info\"\n","def __repr__(self):\n","    return \"Technical info\"\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","### 20. **What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**\n","\n","- `super()` allows you to **call methods of the parent class**, usually inside constructors or overridden methods. It helps in **code reuse and extending functionality**.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 21. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n","\n","- `__del__()` is called when an object is **about to be destroyed**. It's like a destructor and is used to clean up resources, though it’s not commonly used in Python.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 22. **What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n","\n","| Feature        | `@staticmethod` | `@classmethod`                       |\n","| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n","| First argument | None            | Class (`cls`)                        |\n","| Access class?  | No              | Yes                                  |\n","| Use case       | Utility methods | Factory methods or alter class state |\n","\n","\n","\n","### 23. **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n","\n","- When multiple child classes inherit from the same parent and override its methods, you can **call the same method on different objects**, and each will respond differently. Python uses **dynamic typing** to handle this.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","```python\n","for animal in [Dog(), Cat()]:\n","    animal.speak()  # Different results, same method call\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","### 24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n","\n","- Method chaining means calling **multiple methods on the same object in a single line**. To enable this, methods must return `self`.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","```python\n","car.start().accelerate().brake()\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","### 25. **What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**\n","\n","- If a class has a `__call__()` method, then its **objects behave like functions**.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","```python\n","class Greet:\n","    def __call__(self, name):\n","        print(f\"Hello, {name}\")\n","\n","g = Greet()\n","g(\"Alice\")  # Acts like a function\n","```\n","\n",""],"metadata":{"id":"hm8cuv9-FcvB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Practical Questions :**"],"metadata":{"id":"knFkdl5xKADd"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"773d6cd5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753640654045,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Sayan Saha","userId":"17325324671630068064"}},"outputId":"8d08d01a-56ce-4419-e629-a5db318e1d93"},"source":["#1.
